  # Twitter Flash Crash Dataset - DJIA prices on April 23, 2013
  # A fake tweet about an explosion at the White House caused a brief market crash around 1:10 PM
  # Original data: ~405 time points from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM (390 minutes of trading)
  # After normalization, the data is centered at 0 with std ~1
  
  # A_limits: Active learning region (focused around the flash crash event)
  # The crash happened at approximately index 220 out of 405 points (around normalized time ~0)
  # We focus on a window around the crash: roughly -1.5 to 1.5 in normalized time
  # This corresponds to about +/- 60 minutes around the crash in real time
  A_limits: [0.75, 1.25]
  
  # X_limits: Full trading day range (covers ~99.7% of normalized time data)
  # The full normalized time range is approximately [-3, 3] (representing 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM)
  X_limits: [-1.5, 1.5]
  
  num_samples: 405  # Use all available data points from the trading day
  num_train_samples: 50  # Initial training samples (before crash detection)
  num_A_samples: 80  # Dense sampling in the active region around the crash
  seed: 100
